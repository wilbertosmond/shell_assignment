An Introduction to Using Shell

1. Welcome to the Terminal
1.1 Commands. "Get-ChildItem" shows the contents of the current working directory. Columns are "Mode", "LastWriteTime" in date and time, "Length" of characters, "Name" of files.
When typing "Get-Alias ls", it tells me the CommandType (e.g. Alias) of the Name (e.g. ls -> Get-ChildItem)
1.2 Getting some help. Using Get-Help (command/alias) or (command/alias) -? shows the command name, synopsis (i.e. what it does: deletes the specified items), syntax, description (e.g. deletes items), related links, and remarks that it shows only partial help. However, when adding -Detailed at the end of Get-Help (command/alias), it shows an extension of help mainly listing the parameters we can use in the syntax and what they do, as well as some examples.
Looking into the detailed documentation of Get-ChildItem, we can add an option to the gci "-Include *.extension" to only display files with a certain extension.
I played around with the command -Recurse which gets the items in the specified locations and in all child items of the locations

2. Finding Your Way Around
2.1 Looking Around. Using Get-Location, I found that my current working directory is: C:\Users\wilbert osmond\Documents\Semester 6\UCACCMET2J\Week 2 - Python\shell_magic>
I don't see text in different colors, but folders are of mode d and files are of mode a
2.2 Moving Around. Command cd stands for change directory.
sl .. --> move back working directory by one step (i.e. to parent folder)
sl -path "C:\Users\wilbert osmond\Documents\Semester 6\UCACCMET2J\Week 2 - Python\shell_magic" --> move back to folder you started at
